## Features
Users can: 
- add to-do items
- delete individual items 
- delete all completed items
- reorder items by dragging them
- view "All", "Active", or "Completed" items 

## Usage instructions
- Add to-do items by typing, then clicking "Save", or pressing the "Enter" key on your keyboard or smartphone 
- Reorder items by dragging them up or down 
- Toggle items as "completed/active" by clicking or tapping on the item's text
- View all, active, or completed items by using the buttons toward the top 
- Delete items individually by clicking on the "x" to the right side of each item 
- Remove all completed items by clicking the button toward the bottom, below list items.  This function is only available when completed items are visible on the screen, i.e. 1) completed items actually exist and 2) the user has not opted to view "active" items by filtering out completed items
Note: Items are stored locally so they will not sync, and will be lost forever when deleted or when access to that device is no longer available
